Iâ€™m a writer and English teacher. My fiction has been published in journals including <em>Monkey Bicycles</em>, <em>Peatsmoke Journal</em>, and <em>Rathalla Review</em>. My journalism and essays have appeared in outlets such as USA Today, Forbes, Hobart, The Salt Lake Tribune, Seven Days, Salt Lake City Weekly, and Business Insider. In my free time, I enjoy hiking, dancing, and playing board games with my roommates.
